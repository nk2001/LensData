# LensData

This a simple application written in Python. The dataset is from UCI site 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Lenses

The dataset is supposed to be Machine Learning related. Considering the size and completeness
of the data, it is easier to implement the logic in Python program instead of ML modeling.

Files in this directory:
1. app.py - application logic
2. Procfile - Required file for deployment
3. setup.sh - setup and configuration file support for deployment
4. requirements.txt - list of libraries that the application requires to run. 


Heroku deployment is here. http://lensdata.herokuapp.com/
